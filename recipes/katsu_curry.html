                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start to prepare rice: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Put dry rice into pot and wash by running cold water and swirling it around with your fingers</li>
                            <li>Pour out cloudy, starchy water until only a tiny amount is left. Repeat Steps 1 & 2 3-4 times until water becomes clear.</li>
                            <li>Drain rice in a sieve, put it in a medium sized pot, and add 3/4 cup water per 1/2 cup of rice</li>
                            <li>Leave rice to soak for 20-30 mins</li>
                            <li>You could prep veg now to save time later</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>After 30mins, cover rice with lid and bring to boil over a medium heat. This should take ~10 mins. You might want to start breaking up the curry mix block to save time later.</li>
                    <li>At same time, add 1tbsp vegetable oil to a large pot and sweat onions over a medium heat for 5 mins</li>
                    <li>Once the rice starts boiling set timer for 30 minutes and turn hob down to simmer.</li>
                    <li>At the same time, add 750ml cold water to onions, add carrots & potato if using, and bring to boil over medium heat. This should take ~10 mins</li>
                    <li>At 10 minute mark, preheat oven 200&deg;C, 180&deg;C Fan.</li>
                    <li>After 13 mins has passed, take rice off heat and let it sit for at least 10 mins. Put chicken in oven,</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, cover large pot and simmer for 15 mins.</li>
                    <li>Take large pot off heat & add the curry mix. Stir well and dissolve thoroughly. Put pot back on heat and simmer for 5 mins, stirring constantly.</li>
                    <li>Dish out rice, ladle on curry, & by then the chicken should be cooked so take it out, cut it into slices, place on top of rice & and serve</li>
