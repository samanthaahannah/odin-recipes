        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start to prepare rice: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash rice by running cold water into it and swirling it with your hand, then pour cloudy water out until only a tiny amount is left. Repeat this 3-4 time until water becomes clear.</li>
                    <li>Drain rice in a sieve, put it in a medium sized pot and add 3/4 cup water per 1/2 cup of rice and leave to soak for 20-30 mins</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>After 30mins are up, cover rice with lid and bring to boil over a medium heat. This should take about 10 mins. You might want to start breaking up the curry mix block to save time later.</li>
            <li>Around the same time, add a tbsp of vegetable oil to a large pot and sweat onions over a medium heat for five minutes</li>
            <li>Once the rice starts boiling set a timer for 30 minutes and turn it down to a simmer.</li>
            <li>At the same time, add 750ml cold water to onions, add carrots, and bring to boil over medium heat. This should take around 10 mins</li>
            <li>At 10 minute mark, preheat oven 200&#176;C, 180^#176;C Fan.</li>
            <li>Once 13 mins has past on timer, take rice off heat and let it sit for at least 10 mins. Put chicken on baking tray and in oven,</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cover large pot and let it simmer for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>The timer will go off and the rice will be ready but it will keep warm so don't worry about that</li>
            <li>Once the 15 mins are up for large pot, take pot off heat and add the curry mix. Stir well and make sure the mix dissolves completely. Put pot back on heat and simmer for 5 mins, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Start to dish out rice, ladle on curry, & by then the chicken should be cooked so take it out, cut it into slices, place on top of rice & and serve</li>
        </ol>
