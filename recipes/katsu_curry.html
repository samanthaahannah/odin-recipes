            </li>
            <li>After 30mins, cover rice with lid and bring to boil over a medium heat. This should take ~10 mins. You might want to start breaking up the curry mix block to save time later.</li>

            <li>At 10 minute mark, preheat oven 200&#176;C, 180^#176;C Fan.</li>
            <li>After 13 mins has passed, take rice off heat and let it sit for at least 10 mins. Put chicken in oven,</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cover large pot and simmer for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Take large pot off heat & add the curry mix. Stir well and dissolve thoroughly. Put pot back on heat and simmer for 5 mins, stirring constantly.</li>
